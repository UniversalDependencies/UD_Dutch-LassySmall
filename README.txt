This corpus contains sentences from the Wikipedia section of the Lassy Small Treebank.
Universal Dependency annotation was generated automatically from the original annotation in Lassy.

The conversion script (XQuery) is available upon request and can be used to convert additional 
material annotated according to Lassy/CGN guidelines or annotated automatically using the Alpino parser.

The train, development, and test sections consist of 6641, 350, and 350 sentences, respectively, 
taken from a random shuffle of the original dataset.

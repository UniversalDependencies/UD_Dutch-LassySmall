# Summary

This corpus contains sentences from the Wikipedia section of the Lassy Small Treebank.
Universal Dependency annotation was generated automatically from the original annotation in Lassy.

# Introduction

The Lassy Small Treebank (https://www.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/Lassy/) is a manually verified treebank for Dutch, annotated with both phrasal nodes and dependency labels (as in the German Tiger treebanks and as in earlier treebank efforts for Dutch). The annotation was converted automatically to UD.  The (XQuery) conversion script is available for download at https://github.com/gossebouma/lassy2ud. It can be used to convert additional material annotated according to Lassy/CGN guidelines or annotated automatically using the Alpino parser.

As not all material in the Lassy Small Treebank can be made freely available, only the material from the Wikipedia (wiki) section is included in UD_Dutch-LassySmall. The train, development, and test sections consist of 6641, 350, and 350 sentences, respectively, taken from a random shuffle of the original dataset.
